# Flask Market

A full-stack eCommerce web app built while following a guided Flask tutorial. This project helped reinforce my understanding of Flask fundamentals, templating with Jinja2, user authentication, and SQLAlchemy ORM.

## Features

- User registration and login with secure password hashing
- Browse products available for purchase
- Buy/sell item functionality tied to user accounts
- SQLAlchemy models and relationships
- Flask-Bootstrap for UI styling

## What I Learned

- How Flask handles routing, forms, and sessions
- Structuring a basic MVC app with Flask
- Using Jinja2 templates to dynamically render content
- Setting up a SQLite database and working with SQLAlchemy

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Flask
- Flask-WTF
- Flask-Bootstrap
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite

## Notes

This project was built by following a tutorial for learning purposes. All logic was implemented manually, and I experimented with extensions and UI customization to make the app my own.
